        <h3> Favorite artist </h3>
        <p>
            So one of my favorite artist is this rapper Logic,
            he has a song that I love called can I kick it although I like 
            all of his music, this one in particular I love. I love it so much
            that my freshman year here at northwest I wrote a paper about the song 
            and him and his background.

        <h3> Favorite Movie</h3>
        <p>
            So my favorite movie has to be Akira. It's an old anime movie from the
            1990's. It has a iconic scene that inspired many of the cool motorcycle 
            shots you've seen today, the one where the biker comes in and drifts to a
            stop but the bike went from veritcal to horizontal  (if you see the scene 
            you'll know what I'm talking about)
